## We are recruiting

We are looking for a post-doctoral researcher to work on a newly funded DFG grant (see next post). More details can be found [here]( 



## New DFG grant (29.11.2018)

A newly funded DFG grant will allow us to study how speakers plan utterances (i.e., how many words they plan ahead before articulation onset, in which order a words planned within planning units?). To do so, the project capitalizes on cross-linguistic differences in how words constrain the pronunciation of one another in an utterance (e.g., to produce the correct form of the determiner in _Die schwarze Katze_ german speakers must have accessed the gender of the noun. English speakers can produce the determiner in _The black cat_ correctly without havenig accessed the noun.)
Experiments (behavioral, eye-tracking) will be conducted with German, French and English speakers.
