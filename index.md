Emiel van den Hoven joined the lab to work on utterance planning across languages


## New DFG grant (29.11.2018)

A newly funded DFG grant will allow us to study how speakers plan utterances (i.e., how many words they plan ahead before articulation onset, in which order words are encoded within planning units). To do so, the project capitalizes on cross-linguistic differences in how words constrain the pronunciation of one another in an utterance (e.g., to produce the correct form of the determiner in _Die schwarze Katze_ german speakers must have accessed the gender of the noun. English speakers can produce the determiner in _The black cat_ correctly without having accessed the noun.)
Experiments (behavioral, eye-tracking) will be conducted with German, French and English speakers.
