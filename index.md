### New paper accepted in Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience (May 2021)
Congratulations to Hyein Jeong for her first paper! The paper, data and script can be accessed here. https://osf.io/9gy4r/files
The study uses behavioral, acoustic, and neurophysiological data to examine the impact of word co-occurrences (extracted from big corpora) on language production.

### New DFG funded project (April 2021)
The project, entitled "New insights into the speaker’s lexicon: Computational modeling and experimental data” will start in a few months and run during three years. Positions will be available. More soon.

Cheslie Klein and Anna Slocinska have joined the lab and will work with Emiel and I on utterance planning across languages. 



## We are going to ESCOP

Maria, Sylvain, Hyein, Leonie and I will go to ESCOP:
- VARIABILITY AND ORTHOGRAPHY IN LEARNING NEW WORDS (Bürki, Spinelli, Welby)
- THE LOCUS OF PHRASE FREQUENCY EFFECT IN ADJECTIVE-NOUN PHRASE PRODUCTION (Jeong, Bürki)
- SEMANTIC INTERFERENCE AND PHONOLOGICAL FACILITATION IN PICTURE-WORD INTERFERENCE (Madec, Elbuy, Villinger, Bürki)
- SEMANTIC INTEGRATION OF NEW VOCABULARY: DOES LEARNING CONTEXT MATTER? (Korochkina, Bürki, Nickels)


## New Collaborator (01.03.2019)

Emiel van den Hoven joined the lab to work on utterance planning across languages


## New DFG grant (29.11.2018)

A newly funded DFG grant will allow us to study how speakers plan utterances (i.e., how many words they plan ahead before articulation onset, in which order words are encoded within planning units). To do so, the project capitalizes on cross-linguistic differences in how words constrain the pronunciation of one another in an utterance (e.g., to produce the correct form of the determiner in _Die schwarze Katze_ german speakers must have accessed the gender of the noun. English speakers can produce the determiner in _The black cat_ correctly without having accessed the noun.)
Experiments (behavioral, eye-tracking) will be conducted with German, French and English speakers.
